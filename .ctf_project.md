# üö© Capture The Flag: Vault + Vault Radar DevOps Arcade

A hands-on, containerized CTF game that teaches real-world secret management, detection, and remediation using HashiCorp Vault, Vault Radar, and a modern web stack.

## üéÆ Core Design

- **Fork-per-player GitHub workflow:** Every player clones their own fork, guaranteeing isolated progress and a personal Vault Radar report.
- **All local, all containers:** Single script launches Vault, Express backend, Nuxt 3 frontend, and Couchbase.
- **HTTPS-only git:** Keeps onboarding smooth‚Äîno SSH keys or config needed.
- **Preflight checks:** Script verifies runtime, ports, version, and credentials before starting.
- **Nuxt dashboard:** Shows all URLs, credentials, challenge progress, remaining keys, and validation status.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Loop

1. **Setup**
    - Player forks the game repo via GitHub.
    - Clones fork using HTTPS.
    - Runs `./start_ctf.sh`.
    - Script checks for Docker/Podman, ports, and launches containers.

2. **Play**
    - Player opens Nuxt dashboard (`localhost:3000`) for instructions, creds, and next steps.
    - Reviews backend code (in their local editor).
    - Fixes secret leak or challenge as described in Level 1.
    - Clicks ‚ÄúValidate‚Äù in frontend (or runs a CLI).
    - Validation script checks for correct fix:
        - If pass:
            - Automated `commit_gh` (commit & push).
            - Automated restart of affected container.
            - Nuxt updates progress, advances to next level.
        - If fail:
            - Player prompted to retry or use a üîë key (up to 3).
            - On üîë use, a hint is shown.

3. **Radar Integration**
    - Player connects *their* fork to Vault Radar SaaS.
    - Radar scan is part of pass/fail check for certain levels.

4. **Progression**
    - Each level represents a real-world secret management issue.
    - Must pass each level to unlock the next.
    - ‚ÄúLives‚Äù (üîë keys) allow retries or hints; lose all = reset.

5. **Reset**
    - `./start_ctf.sh --reset` returns all services and code to starting state.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Nuxt 3 frontend**: Dashboard, validation UI, level display, hints.
- **Express backend**: API endpoints, level validation, automated git/compose integration.
- **Vault (Dev mode)**: All real secret storage, moves from ‚Äúbad‚Äù static keys to dynamic best practices.
- **Couchbase NoSQL**: Game data, potential secret storage in bad/early levels.
- **Docker Compose/Podman Compose**: Orchestration; single script for all services.

## üü© Why It Will Work

- **Player isolation via forks:** No cross-player state, no race conditions.
- **Containerization:** All dependencies local and versioned.
- **Automated validation, commit, and restart:** No manual steps missed.
- **HTTPS-only git:** Universal, cross-platform, minimal setup friction.
- **Preflight checks:** Proactively prevent 90% of ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt it work?‚Äù errors.

## üîë Example Level 1 Flow

1. Player sees a hardcoded API key in `backend/config.js`.
2. Fixes it to pull from Vault.
3. Clicks ‚ÄúValidate‚Äù‚Äîscript checks for correct fix, restarts backend, commits/pushes change.
4. Nuxt frontend shows success, unlocks Level 2.
5. Player runs Vault Radar on their fork for extra validation.

## üìù Onboarding Steps

1. Fork the repo via GitHub.
2. Clone with HTTPS.
3. Run `./start_ctf.sh`.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` and follow the dashboard.
5. After each fix, push via Validate button (auto-commits), then scan your fork with Vault Radar.

## üö¶ Troubleshooting

- ‚ÄúNo container runtime found!‚Äù ‚Äî> install Docker or Podman, see install section.
- ‚ÄúPort in use‚Äù ‚Äî> close conflicting service or change port in `.env`.
- ‚ÄúNot on your fork‚Äù ‚Äî> re-fork and clone your own repo.
- ‚ÄúValidation fails after fix‚Äù ‚Äî> try restart, check your code, or use a üîë key for a hint.
- ‚ÄúGit push fails‚Äù ‚Äî> check HTTPS remote and GitHub authentication.
- ‚ÄúVault Radar scan fails‚Äù ‚Äî> check SaaS connection, rate limits, or try again later.

## üéØ CTF Level Ladder: Defender of the Gate to Guardian of the Galaxy

### Level 1: Defender of the Gate
**Scenario:**  
A plaintext API key is hardcoded in backend source code.

**Skill:**  
Spot and remediate obvious static secrets.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player removes the hardcoded key from code.
- Configures backend to fetch the key from Vault.
- Restarts backend, commits/pushes change.
- **Validator:** Checks code for no hardcoded key and confirms app loads key from Vault.

---

### Level 2: Env File Sentry
**Scenario:**  
A `.env` file with sensitive secrets is included in the repo and not gitignored.

**Skill:**  
Identify, gitignore, and migrate secrets to Vault.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player removes `.env` from tracked files and adds it to `.gitignore`.
- Moves secrets to Vault; backend loads secrets from Vault only.
- **Validator:** No secrets present in `.env` or code, `.gitignore` entry exists, app runs.

---

### Level 3: History Hunter
**Scenario:**  
An API secret has been removed from source, but it remains in Git history.

**Skill:**  
Git forensics with BFG/filter-branch; secret rotation.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player rewrites Git history to erase the secret from all commits.
- Rotates secret in Vault.
- Force-pushes cleaned history to their fork.
- **Validator:** Secret no longer present in any git commit; current and past Radar scans pass.

---

### Level 4: The CI/CD Canary
**Scenario:**  
A CI/CD workflow writes secrets to the build log.

**Skill:**  
CI log scanning, masking, and secret hygiene.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player updates CI config to mask/sequester secrets from logs.
- Rotates any leaked secrets.
- **Validator:** New pipeline runs don‚Äôt leak; logs are clean and Radar scan passes.

---

### Level 5: Keeper of the Shards
**Scenario:**  
A Vault unseal key or sensitive value is accidentally committed in a config or random file.

**Skill:**  
Code review, secret rotation, secure configuration management.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player removes the secret from files and rotates Vault keys.
- Commits/pushes fix.
- **Validator:** Secret is purged from codebase and Radar; Vault status healthy.

---

### Level 6: Policy Locksmith
**Scenario:**  
An over-privileged Vault token (‚Äúroot‚Äù) is used by an app.

**Skill:**  
Vault policy scoping, least-privilege principles.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player replaces root token with minimally scoped token.
- Updates backend to use only the needed permissions.
- **Validator:** App config checked for token scope, fails if still overprivileged.

---

### Level 7: The Rotkeeper‚Äôs Trial
**Scenario:**  
An expired or revoked secret is still present as a fallback in code or config.

**Skill:**  
Active secret rotation, removing stale credentials.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player finds and deletes expired credentials from all configs and code.
- Ensures app always fetches current secret from Vault.
- **Validator:** No fallback secrets present; Vault secrets in use; app starts without error.

---

### Level 8: The Phantom Layer
**Scenario:**  
Sensitive info is buried inside a Docker image layer from a bad build.

**Skill:**  
Container forensics, image scanning, secure Dockerfile practices.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player rebuilds Docker image using best practices (multi-stage, no secrets in build args).
- Validates with image scanning tool that no secrets exist in any layer.
- **Validator:** Radar (or local scan) shows no secrets in new image.

---

### Level 9: The Policy Paradox
**Scenario:**  
A Vault policy or role grants overly broad (‚Äú*‚Äù) access to secrets.

**Skill:**  
RBAC review, policy testing, and enforcement.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player rewrites policy to narrow allowed paths/actions.
- Tests that only intended secrets are accessible.
- **Validator:** Policy config validated for least-privilege; access denied for non-permitted secrets.

---

### Level 10: Guardian of the Galaxy
**Scenario:**  
The ‚Äúmaster flag‚Äù is split across encoded hints in code, database, and git history‚Äîonly solvable by applying every best practice learned.

**Skill:**  
Full-stack secret forensics, code/database/historical hunting, and end-to-end remediation.

**Expected Resolution:**  
- Player finds all clues, decodes master flag, and remediates all forms of secret leakage (static, historic, DB, config, image, logs).
- All secrets are dynamic, Vault-managed, RBAC is enforced, and audits/logs are clean.
- **Validator:** All previous checks pass; master flag is submitted and validated; no leaks anywhere.

---

**Accessibility & Disability Considerations:**
- All hints, progress, and errors must be available as both text in the terminal and in the web UI.
- No puzzle relies solely on color, animation, or mouse actions; every step can be completed by keyboard and CLI.
- Credentials, URLs, and hints should always be copyable (no ‚Äúvisual-only‚Äù artifacts).
- Option to play *entirely* via CLI/terminal (for screen reader or non-UI users).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Sequential Level Progression: No Skipping Allowed

To ensure a true learning and challenge path, players **must solve each level in order**‚Äîno skipping ahead (e.g., solving Level 4 before Level 2).

### How It‚Äôs Enforced

- **Player Progress Tracking**
  - Each player‚Äôs current level is tracked (e.g., in a local file, database, or in Couchbase).
  - Example state:  
    `{ "user": "player1", "currentLevel": 2, "keysLeft": 2 }`

- **Validation Logic (Backend/CLI)**
  - When the player attempts to validate a level:
    - If it matches their current level:  
      - Validation proceeds.  
      - On pass: Progress is updated, and next level is unlocked.
    - If they try a locked/future level:  
      - Validation is denied.
      - Message:  
        `"You must complete Level X before attempting Level Y."`

- **Frontend Experience**
  - Nuxt dashboard:
    - Only shows ‚ÄúValidate‚Äù button for the unlocked level.
    - Future levels are locked/greyed out until previous is complete.
    - Progress and remaining keys are always visible.
  - CLI-only mode:
    - Each `validate_levelX.sh` checks progress before running; prints error if player is not on the right level.

- **Prevents Manual Workarounds**
  - All backend/API/CLI validation checks consult the same player state.
  - Even if scripts or endpoints for future levels are run, validation will refuse to advance progress out-of-order.

### Example User Flow

| Attempt                                 | Allowed? | Response                                      |
|------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Validate current level (in order)        | ‚úÖ       | ‚ÄúSuccess! Level X complete. Next level unlocked.‚Äù |
| Attempt to validate future/skipped level | ‚ùå       | ‚ÄúLocked. Complete Level Y first.‚Äù             |
| Re-validate already-completed level      | Optional | ‚ÄúAlready completed. You are on Level X.‚Äù      |

**Result:**  
Players learn and progress step by step, and nobody can ‚Äúcheat‚Äù their way to Guardian of the Galaxy without earning every badge along the way!

## ‚è≥ Countdown Timer Mechanic

To increase challenge and replay value, the CTF features a countdown timer (per-level or whole-game):

- **Per-Level Timer:** Each level gives you a set amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to solve and validate the challenge. If the timer runs out before success, you lose a üîë key (or the level resets).
- **Whole-Game Timer:** Optionally, complete all 10 levels within a total time limit for extra glory (and leaderboard bragging rights).

**Implementation:**
- Timer is shown in the Nuxt dashboard and in terminal output (for CLI mode).
- Timer state is saved between page reloads and can be tracked in backend or local state file.
- If time expires:
    - You lose a key, see a hint, or face ‚Äúgame over‚Äù (configurable).
    - Accessible mode can offer more time or disable the timer as needed.

---

---

## ‚è≥ Timer Configuration

You can set the CTF game timers using environment variables or script arguments:

- `LEVEL_TIME` ‚Äî time allowed per level, in minutes (default: `5`)
- `GAME_TIME`  ‚Äî total time allowed for the whole game, in minutes (default: `60`)

**Override in your shell before starting:**
```bash
export LEVEL_TIME=10
export GAME_TIME=120
./start_ctf.sh

---

---

## ü™™ Bonus Rewards: Lock Pick & Security Badge

For extra challenge and recognition, the CTF awards a bonus **Security Badge (Lock Pick)** if you reach a key milestone (e.g., Level 6) within half the total game time:

- **How to earn:**  
  - Reach Level 6 before the halfway mark (e.g., 30 minutes if `GAME_TIME=60`).
- **Reward:**  
  - Instantly receive one extra üîë key (‚Äúlife‚Äù) for retries or hints.
  - Display a digital badge (ü™™) in your dashboard and commits.
  - Optionally, unlock a secret leaderboard or bonus challenge.

**Sample Message:**  
> üèÖ **Bonus Unlocked!**  
> You reached Level 6 in record time and earned the ü™™ Security Badge (Lock Pick).  
> +1 üîë key added!

## üåê Sync Your Score to the Global Leaderboard

At the end of your CTF run, click the ‚ÄúSync to Leaderboard‚Äù button (in the Nuxt UI) or run:

```bash
./sync_leaderboard.sh

---

---

## **Challenges/Considerations**
- **Cheating:**  
  - You can‚Äôt prevent all local cheating, but a simple hash or validation code can add friction.
- **Privacy:**  
  - Make anonymous/pseudonym submissions the default.
- **API Abuse:**  
  - Add basic rate-limiting or manual moderation if needed.
